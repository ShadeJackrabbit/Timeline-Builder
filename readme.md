#CSV Timeline Interpreter

An interpreter to take a CSV file of a timeline and turn that into an HTML5 visual representation. This can then be further taken to print, modify, style, however you want via the usage of CSS.

##Requirements
* [Economica Font](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/economica)
* Roboto Font
* Any program to write a CSV. Notepad will do.
* Python 3.4
* Something to read HTML files. A browser will do ;)

##CSV Layout
At the moment the CSV must be laid out with four columns: **Year, Event, Category, Description**. These can be in any order, however the first row of the CSV file must describe which column is which.
